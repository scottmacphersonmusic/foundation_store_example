by [Scott Macpherson](https://github.com/scottmacphersonmusic)
### Description
**rails_store_example** is a minimal Rails app using scaffolding for the purpose of learning about the Foundation framework. The app was produced by following along with this [RailsCasts video](http://railscasts.com/episodes/417-foundation?view=asciicast).
### Known Issues
- Customizing css colors doesn't appear to be taking effect.
- Some classes added to the form elements are not having an effect.
- Adding `title: "Price in USD", data: {tooltip: true}` to the price label doesn't do anything.
